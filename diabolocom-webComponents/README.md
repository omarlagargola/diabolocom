# Webcomponents

Here I am using the 4 webcomponentes as described.

First just do a `npm install` and then a `npm run dev` to start the server.

In order to use the web components from the other project, I just built them and then copy the contend from the `dist` folder in that project to the `dist` folder in this project.

Then I could use them directly in the `index.html` file.

I also implemented test with `playwright`, to run them just do `npm run test`. Is possible that it will ask you to install browsers, just accept it.

I knew that it was possible to convert vue components into web components, I never done it before though.

It was fun :)
